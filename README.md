# Image Classification
Notebook made for the Kaggle competition of the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning at Politecnico di Milano. 


We had to solve an image classification problem on a dataset composed by images of people with and without face masks. In particular, you were required to classify images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. In the specific, our solution had to discriminate between images depending on the following cases: 1) All the people in the image are wearing a mask, 2) No person in the image is wearing a mask, 3) Someone in the image is not wearing a mask.
